Node File System and HTTP Module Exercise

In this exercise, we will leverage both the file system and http requests and responses to spin up node and reads html file and returns its content!

1. From the terminal, create a html file 'demofile1.html' which includes in the body a header with the first header tag 'My Header' and a paragraph tag which contains 'My Paragraph' within.

2. Create a Javascript file 'exercise.js' which will serve as our node server.


3. Create a server pointed at the port 4000 which reads the demofile1.html and returns its content.
